# the-lions-den-poker
A program that allows 2 heads up no limit hold'em poker bots to play against each other by communicating using text files.
The Lion's Den acts as a dealer between the 2 competing bots and keeps track of the winnings/losses by both bots in a text file.

# The game
The game managed by this program is Heads Up No-Limit Hold'Em, Doyle's Game. The stack sizes for both bots are reset after each hand and the net results are kept track over time.

# TheLionsDen.cpp
The main program set up that allows 2 bots to play against each other.

# PlayLionsDen.cpp
An altered version of The Lion's Den that allows the user to play against another bot in the terminal.
